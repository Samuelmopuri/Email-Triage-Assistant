1. Project Overview
The Email Triage Assistant is an agentic automation tool designed to manage high-volume email environments. It leverages the Gmail API for data retrieval and GPT-4o for semantic analysis, providing a "triage" layer that summarizes, prioritizes, and drafts responses for incoming communications.

2. Problem Statement
Professional communication often suffers from "information density," where critical tasks are buried within:

Voluminous Threads: Long conversation histories (50+ messages) that are time-consuming to parse.

High Noise-to-Signal Ratio: Promotional content and automated notifications obscuring urgent human-to-human interaction.

Unstructured Requests: Meeting requests and deadlines that require manual calendar entry.

3. System Architecture
The application follows a linear data pipeline designed for speed and accuracy.

A. Data Ingestion Layer
Service: Google Discovery API (Gmail v1).

Method: The system uses the list method with a query filter is:unread to target fresh data.

Authentication: Managed via OAuth 2.0. The application utilizes a local token storage system (token.json) to minimize repeated login prompts while maintaining secure access.

B. The "ScaleDown" Engine (Processing)
To maintain efficiency and stay within LLM token limits, the engine performs a "ScaleDown" operation:

Context Truncation: The system captures the most relevant portion of the email payload (up to 3000 characters).

Redundancy Filter: Redundant metadata, email signatures, and legal disclaimers are bypassed to focus the model on the conversation's core content.

C. AI Triage Logic (The Brain)
The core analysis is performed using a single-pass inference strategy. Instead of multiple API calls, the system uses a structured system prompt to extract six distinct data points simultaneously:

Summarization: 85% compression of the original text.

Priority Scoring: A 1-10 urgency rating based on sender context and sentiment.

Categorization: Assignment to "Smart Folders" (e.g., Finance, Social, Work).

Meeting Extraction: Identifying temporal entities (dates/times).

NLG Drafting: Generating a professional, one-sentence response template.

Subscription Audit: Determining if the email originates from a newsletter or mailing list.

5. Security & Privacy Considerations
Minimal Scoping: The app uses the gmail.readonly scope, ensuring that the assistant cannot send, delete, or modify emails without a code-level upgrade to a more permissive scope.

Local Processing: Credentials and API keys are stored locally and are excluded from version control via .gitignore to prevent unauthorized access to the developer's Workspace.
